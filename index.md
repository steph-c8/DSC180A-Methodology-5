Section A10
Rasmus S Nielsen

1. **For sure the ethics behind data science in everyday life. I love the discussions we have about readings regarding this topic, it's super relevant and complex!**
   
3. **I would love to look into the ethics of data collection and analysis at the university level, particulary regarding university admissions.**
   
5. **I wish we as a group worked as a team more. It felt very disconnected and I feel like we all came out of it having only learned bits and pieces of the topic.**
   
7. **I am interested in really learning about bias mitigation and ways to implement different techniques from scratch.**
